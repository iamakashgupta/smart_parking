/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data,
 *              allows public read access to parking lot and slot information,
 *              and restricts administrative data to authorized users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}: Stores user's vehicles. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores user's bookings. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /parking_lots/{parkingLotId}: Stores parking lot information. Publicly readable.
 * - /parking_lots/{parkingLotId}/slots/{slotId}: Stores slot information. Publicly readable.
 * - /receipts/{receiptId}: Stores receipts. Only accessible to the user who made the booking.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction details. Only accessible to admins.
 * - /pricing/{pricingId}: Stores pricing rules. Only accessible to admins.
 * - /logs/{logId}: Stores log entries. Only accessible to admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly controlled by user-ownership enforced via path-based rules.
 * - Parking lot and slot data is publicly readable to facilitate real-time updates.
 * - Listing of parking lots and slots is allowed, as this data is considered public.
 * - Administrative collections (transactions, pricing, logs) are not accessible in this prototype.
